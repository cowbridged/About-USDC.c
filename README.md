USDC Bridged Solana (USDC.c) is a wrapped representation of USD Coin on the Solana mainnet (Decimals: 6). USDC.c is transparently pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and is backed by verifiable on-chain reserves across multiple Solana wallets. The project is engineered to combine institutional-grade stability with Solana’s low fees and high throughput, providing a resilient dollar settlement layer for DeFi, payments, and cross-chain liquidity.

Token supply and circulation are publicly visible (Total Supply: 9,988,776,600,000 • Circulating Supply: 9,988,770,600,000). All reserve and holder data can be independently inspected via Solscan: https://solscan.io/token/CNKSdeoP5yqkhW5q94iqZWvGNN4WS3G8y41dcb1vBePv and the holders visualization link above. On-chain reserves are held across multiple multi-signature wallets (listed below) to ensure custody separation and continuous public visibility.

To ensure robust security and trust, USDC.c will commission independent smart-contract security reviews and public audits from leading blockchain security firms (for example: CertiK, OpenZeppelin, Quantstamp — auditors to be engaged and reports published). In addition, periodic reserve attestations by an independent accounting firm (Big Four or equivalent) will be completed and made available to the community.

Strategic integrations are targeted with major Solana DeFi platforms (Raydium, Orca, Jupiter, Saber, Serum and other ecosystem partners). Official integration details (pool addresses, LP contract info, and partner announcements) will be published prior to any liquidity launches. All governance, custody and attestation documentation will be posted on the project website and GitHub for full third-party verification.

USDC Bridged Solana is positioned to be the default dollar standard for the Solana ecosystem—combining transparent reserves, auditability, and extreme performance to support the next generation of DeFi and payments.
